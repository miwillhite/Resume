%h2 Objective
%p.objective
  %strong To exceed my own expectations.

  First and foremost, I am a problem solver. I am an advocate for simple code and design, even when backed with a complex architecture. I bring a different perspective to the teams I work with. The wide variety of experiences that I have lend themselves well to a small team.
  / This still needs help, not sure how to tie it back to the company
